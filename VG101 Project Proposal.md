## 3. Project Name: C++-based Rhythm Game

## 4. Intended Language: C++ (May involve little parts with MATLAB)

## 5. Project Summary
This project aims to make a rhythm game by C++ and OpenGL, with a Graphical User Interface provided. *An advanced goal is to make a converter that can convert .mp3 music file into .osu like track file with MATLAB. This part may not be achieved if time is not enough.*

## 6. Motivation
Music games can help players relax and increase their sense of music. Developing a simple music game is a challenge as well as a meaningful task for us. We can learn useful concepts and applications of C++ that may not be learned in class while developing. (e.g. class, virtual function, OpenGL, etc.)
